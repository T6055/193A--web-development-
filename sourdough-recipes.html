  <h2>Basic Sourdough Bread</h2>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>100 grams sourdough starter</li>
    <li>350 grams of warm water</li>
    <li>500 grams bread flour</li>
    <li>7-9 grams of teaspoons salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sourdough starter, warm water, and flour</li>
    <li>Then add the salt. Mix until the dough begins to come together.</li>
    <li>Once you see that there is no left over flour and all incoropated let sit for 30 minutes to an hour. </li>
    <li>After you let it rest you will now start your stretch and folds (you'll do this 3-4 times). </li>
    <li>I like to place a towel over the bowl or you can use a towel (your personal preference).</li>
    <li>With your stretch and fold youll pull one side of the dough up and flip ir over the rest of the dough do this 4 times rotating the bowl.</li>
    <li>Make sure to do this 30 minutes to 1 hour apart.</li>
    <li>After the 4 stretch and folds then youll let it rest for about 6 hours but it depends on how warm it is in your house.</li>
    <li>You'll then do your do your final proof in the fridge for no less than 12 hours in a well floured proofing bowl with a shower cap.</li>
    <li>After the 12 hours youre ready to bake!</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees farenheit and place the dutch oven inside to preheat as well</li>
    <li>Then once preheated for about 30 minutes take dutch oven out and place sourdough on parchment paper and score</li>
    <li>Bake with lid on for 30 minutes </li>
    <li>Then take lid off and bake for about 40 minutes</li>
    <li>Once done, take out of oven and let cool for about an hour or 2 before cutting into</li>
    <li>Last step is to enjoy!!</li>
